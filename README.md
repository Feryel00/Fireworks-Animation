This mini project involves creating a realistic firework effect using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The objective is to continuously simulate fireworks on the screen, creating a dynamic and attractive animation.

In this project, we use HTML to create a basic structure, CSS to style the firework particles, and JavaScript to dynamically generate the particles and control their movement and appearance.

Each firework particle is represented by a small colored circle that appears at random positions on the screen and moves vertically upwards while gradually decreasing in size and opacity, thus creating the effect of a firework explosion.

The firework animation is continuous, with new particles generated at random intervals, giving the impression of an endless firework display and creating an immersive visual experience.

This mini project demonstrates the use of advanced animation techniques in CSS and JavaScript to create a realistic and dynamic effect, ideal for use on websites or applications to add a festive and attractive touch.
